# Traffic-Light-Controller-using--Verilog
Designed a T-intersection Traffic Light Controller using Verilog HDL and implemented it in the Vivado Design Suite. The project features a finite state machine to manage traffic flow efficiently and was verified through simulation and testbenches for real-time control applications.
